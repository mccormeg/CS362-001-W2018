The first bug is in Appt.java inside the isValid() method. Inside this 
version of code is the statement: 
int NumDaysInMonth= CalendarUtil.NumDaysInMonth(startYear,startMonth%12);
This causes my test that checks if February 30th is a valid date to fail 
because of the NumDaysInMonth to work the arguments need to be startYear,
and startMonth - 1.

The second bug is in TimeTable,java within the GetApptRange() method. Within the for loop the conditional should be i < appts.size() but instead is i < appt.size()-1. This causes the application to miss one of the appts within the linked list which cold cause the program to have false positives.
